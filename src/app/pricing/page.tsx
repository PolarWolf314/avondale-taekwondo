              What is International Taekwon-Do (ITF)?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              ITF (International Taekwon-Do Federation) is a traditional martial
              art focused on self-defense, discipline, and technical precision.
              Our club follows the ITF syllabus, including patterns, sparring,
              and breaking techniques.

              How long does it take to get my black belt?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              On average it takes a dedicated student 6-8 years to achieve their
              Black Belt. It is possible to do this more quickly; however we
              recommend that you take your time and fully understand the art
              that you are learning.

              No, beginners are always welcome! Our classes cater to all skill

          <AccordionItem value="1">
            <AccordionTrigger>How often should I train?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              We offer two training sessions per week. We recommend that you
              come to every session for steady progress, but you should train as
              often as your schedule allows. As you rank up, we expect you to be
              doing extra trainings outside of classes.

            <AccordionContent>
              Comfortable sportswear is fine for your first few sessions. Once
              you decide to commit to training, youâ€™ll need an ITF-approved
              dobok (uniform). Remember to bring water.

            <AccordionContent>
              Grading is held every few months and tests your progress through
              patterns, sparring, step-sparring, self-defense, and theory. Each
              successful grading brings you closer to earning your black belt.

              There is not an explicit age limit. We are one of the few clubs in
              NZ that continues to train adults and children together in the
              same class. However because of this, children need to show some
              basic levels of maturity. There is no upper age limit.
